# e-commerce

## Description

I built this project to help a manager at a interent company to be able to use the latest technology in back-end for thier e-commerce website so that thier company can compete with other e-commerce companies. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this project, to see it come to life and be beneficial to every store owner/manger when applying proper back-end to their website. I was given a functional Express.js API in which I set up to add a database name, using a MySQL username and password in a environment variable to connect the database using Sequelize. By running schema and seed commands, a database is created with the test data. When the application is invoked, then the server is started. The models are synced to the database. We are now able to open API Get routes in Insomnia Core for the categories, tags, and products. Each route is displayed in a formatted JSON. We can test the API Post, put, and Delete routes in Insomina Core. I was able to succesfully create new tags, categories, and products. As well as able to update them and delete them in the database. To make the back-end function as it should I had to learn many new things. I had to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I needed to use a dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like MySQL username, password and database name. I learned how to properly create database models. I had to execute association methods on the Sequelize models to create the relationships between them. I completed API routes to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using the Sequelize models. With these skills applied I was able to get this project to operate as it should. It was a great experience to create a back-end for an online e-commerce store so it will be able to compete with other e-commerce companies.
